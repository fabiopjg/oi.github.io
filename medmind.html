            <p>How the meditation can help you and your health...</p>

            <p> Nowadays meditation is so important for our lives. We are so engaged in the digital world that we have forgotten our health and mind.<br/>In your day, I'm pretty sure that you have five minutes to practice this method, you can find in your schedule a time to relax and don't do anything. Just breathe and be fluid... </p>

                <h2>Why meditation is a good practice?</h2>
                <p>Well, I have meditated almost every day, I'm trying to change this "almost" for a "habit". Meditation is to have a connection with yourself and organize your feelings and thinkings. Before, I believed meditation only to sleep, but this year I started meditating again and I have to learn more and more about its rewards.</p>
